# short description of the publication
motivation: "Orientation and Mobility (O&M) can be defined as a set of concepts, skills and techniques that enable people with vision impairments to travel an environment safely and independently. Orientation refers to people's ability to position themselves in the environment, reflected in their awareness of where they are and where they want to go, while mobility refers to people's ability to move independently from one place to another in a safe, effective and efficient manner. These two interlinked concepts play a very important role in the lives of people with vision impairments in general and are extremely important to children, as the ability to travel independently provides access to a wide range of activities that enable people to participate in society."

work: "In this thesis, we aim to investigate current methodologies for O&M training and to design, develop and evaluate novel technological solutions to improve its effectiveness and engagement. In particular, we aim to explore how games can improve engagement in learning O&M concepts, techniques, and skills. We see opportunities for technology to further support O&M training activities both during and after classes with O&M specialists/teachers. You will conduct user studies early on to engage O&M specialists and blind children in co-design sessions ensuring user engagement and representation. This work will conclude with a user study evaluating the technological solution developed.
